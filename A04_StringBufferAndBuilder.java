        // StringBuffer is synchronized, meaning its methods are thread-safe and can be safely used in a multithreaded environment. On the other hand, StringBuilder is not synchronized, which makes it faster than StringBuffer, but it is not thread-safe and should not be used in a multithreaded environment

        // Double of 23 is 46, but StringBuffer typically increases the capacity slightly more (in this case, to 48) to optimize space and avoid reallocating too often.
        //ðŸ“Œ The capacity increase isn't always a strict doubling, and implementations may vary slightly depending on Java version or platform.
        //ðŸ“Œ This extra capacity allows StringBuffer to handle future appends more efficiently, as reallocating a larger buffer less often improves performance.
